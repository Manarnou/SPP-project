# SPP-project
As part of a course project, I developed a Python code to study the behavior of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPP) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) using the Kretschmann-Raether configuration, as illustrated in configuration-figure (uploaded in the repository).

## Data Extraction:
The refractive index data of the metals was manually extracted from refractiveindex.info and saved in a text file, which is then read and extrapolated by the code for further calculations.
## Reflection Coefficient Calculations:
Computes the reflectivity as the square modulus of total reflection coeffecient at different incident angles employing Snellâ€™s Law and the TM-polarized light reflection coefficient equations.
## Figure of Merit (FOM) Calculation:
Calculates the Figure of Merit (FOM) (refer to SPR-response-gold.. file uploaded in the repository)  to evaluate the efficiency of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) in sensors. This helps assess the sensitivity and effectiveness of SPR-based sensors, which operate using a He-Ne laser. the assesment is perfomed through: 
       SPR Response Shift Analysis: Investigates the shift in the SPR response over variations in refractive index (RI), using different metals with varying thicknesses to assess sensor performance.

The code provides valuable insights into the efficiency of SPR sensors and helps optimize them for practical applications.
