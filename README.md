# SPP-project
As part of a course project, I developed a Python code to study the behavior of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPP) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) using the Kretschmann-Raether configuration, as illustrated in Picture 1 (uploaded in the repository).

## Data Extraction:
The refractive index data was manually extracted and saved in a text file, which is then read by the code for further calculations.
## Reflection Coefficient Calculations:
Computes the square modulus of reflectivity at different incident angles using Snellâ€™s Law and the TM-polarized light reflection coefficient equations.
## Figure of Merit (FOM) Calculation:
Calculates the Figure of Merit (FOM) (refer to SPR-response-gold.. file uploaded in the repository)  to evaluate the efficiency of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) in sensors. This helps assess the sensitivity and effectiveness of SPR-based sensors, which operate using a He-Ne laser. the assesment is perfomed by: 
## SPR Response Shift Analysis:
Investigates the shift in the SPR response over variations in refractive index (RI), using different metals with varying thicknesses to assess sensor performance.

The code provides valuable insights into the efficiency of SPR sensors and helps optimize them for practical applications.
